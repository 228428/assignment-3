        <h2>Bhutan's Landmark</h2>
        <p>
          Bhutan is a small yet deeply spiritual country nestled in the Eastern
          Himalayas, bordered by India and China. Known for its breathtaking
          mountain landscapes, ancient monasteries, and commitment to Gross
          National Happiness, Bhutan is one of the few nations in the world
          where traditional culture and Buddhist values remain closely woven
          into everyday life. The country has preserved much of its heritage
          through careful governance and a strong sense of national identity,
          visible in its architecture, clothing, language, and sacred rituals.
          Dzongs fortress monasteries are found across the country, acting as
          both spiritual centers and administrative buildings. These structures,
          with their massive white walls and intricately painted wooden windows,
          embody Bhutan's unique blend of serenity and strength.

        <h2>Tashichoe Dzong</h2>
        <p>
          This is Tashichho Dzong (བཀྲ་ཤིས་ཆོས་རྫོང་), the iconic fortress in
          Bhutan's capital, Thimphu, where the King's office, key ministries,
          and the summer residence of the Je Khenpo are located. Originally
          built in 1641 by Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal and later rebuilt in the
          1960s by the Third King without using a single nail or blueprint, it
          stands as a symbol of tradition and power. It's also the Dzong of my
          own Dzongkhag, the district I grew up in. I still remember being woken
          at 3 AM by my parents to attend Namgay Tongchoe (གནམས་དགའ་མཐོང་མཆོད་),
          the highest form of prayer you can do for yourself, walking half
          asleep toward flickering butter lamps and the low hum of chanting
          monks. Every year, the Dzong transforms into a vibrant stage for
          Thimphu Tshechu, one of Bhutan's grandest spiritual festivals. Nestled
          by the Wang Chhu River with its towering white walls and intricate
          woodwork, Tashichho Dzong is not just a historic landmark it's a
          living memory of my childhood, faith, and roots.

        <h2>Memorial Chorten</h2>
        <p>
          This is the National Memorial Chorten, one of the most sacred and
          frequented landmarks in Thimphu. Built in 1974 in memory of His
          Majesty Jigme Dorji Wangchuck, the Third King of Bhutan and the father
          of modern Bhutan, the chorten stands not only as a monument of
          national reverence but as a daily spiritual anchor for the local
          community. From dawn to dusk, elderly devotees and young passersby
          alike walk in a clockwise direction around the stupa, spinning prayer
          wheels and murmuring mantras like Om Mani Padme Hum. That same
          direction of movement inspired the rotation in my visual work,
          reflecting how devotion is expressed not only through prayer, but
          through the act of movement itself measured, intentional, and
          circular. The chorten's golden spire catches the morning light, and
          its whitewashed body is framed by a garden filled with incense,
          flowers, and quiet reflection. It"s not just a place of worship, but a
          living pulse of the city gentle, grounding, and eternal.

        <h2>Phunakha Dzong</h2>
        <p>
          This is Punakha Dzong (ཕུ་ན་ཁ་རྫོང་), one of Bhutan's most important
          and visually striking fortresses, located at the confluence of the Pho
          Chhu and Mo Chhu rivers. Known for its warm, almost tropical climate,
          Punakha rarely ever sees snow but the photo my father took shows a
          rare moment when it did, the first snowfall in my lifetime, and
          possibly in decades. The contrast between the white snow and the
          Dzong's usual bright, dry surroundings was striking. Built in 1637 by
          Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal, Punakha Dzong was once the capital of
          Bhutan and still serves as the winter residence of the Central
          Monastic Body. It's also the site of major events like royal weddings
          and the annual Punakha Tshechu. The structure's scale and location
          make it one of the most architecturally impressive dzongs in the
          country and seeing it under snow added a quiet, unexpected layer to a
          place so familiar.

        <h2>Dochula</h2>
        <p>
          This is Dochula Pass (རྡོ་ཆ་ལ་), a high-mountain pass that sits at
          over 3,100 meters above sea level, just a short drive from Thimphu.
          It's one of the most scenic spots in Bhutan, offering panoramic views
          of the eastern Himalayas on clear days. For me, Dochula is more than
          just a viewpoint it's a place I've passed countless times on my way to
          Punakha, Wangdue, and beyond. It feels like a threshold between
          valleys, a quiet pause before the next journey. But it also carries
          deeper meaning. The 108 Druk Wangyal Chortens that crown the pass were
          built in honor of the Bhutanese soldiers who lost their lives during
          Operation All Clear in 2003, when the Royal Bhutan Army successfully
          cleared Indian insurgent camps from southern Bhutan. It's a reminder
          that even in a peaceful country like ours, sacrifices have been made
          to preserve that peace. Today, Dochula stands as both a memorial and a
          must visit destination where beauty, history, and reflection converge.

        <h2>Wangdue Dzong</h2>
        <p>
          This is Wangdue Phodrang Dzong (དབང་འདུས་ཕོ་བྲང་རྫོང་), located on a
          ridge overlooking the convergence of the Punatsangchhu and Dangchhu
          rivers. The photo taken by my father is special because it captures a
          rare snowfall in Wangdue, a place known for its dry, breezy climate
          where snow is almost unheard of. Originally built in 1638 by Zhabdrung
          Ngawang Namgyal, the dzong played a key role in controlling the routes
          to central and eastern Bhutan. Tragically, it was destroyed by a fire
          in 2012, which gutted much of the historic structure. Since then, the
          government and local communities have been working to reconstruct the
          dzong using traditional materials and techniques, preserving its
          original architectural style. The image of it covered in snow after a
          time of restoration adds another layer to its long and resilient
          story.
