      This project began as an exploration into transforming 2D images into
      spatial, living forms using TouchDesigner. I wanted to create something
      that felt both structured and organic—almost like a floating pixel
      sculpture. The final look was inspired by the textures of traditional
      Bhutanese architecture, but reimagined through a digital lens. To start,I
      used a Constant CHOP to set the resolution (I chose 500), then connected
      it to a Null to stabilize the value. Before diving into instancing, I
      built a rendering network: I created a Box SOP, added a Transform SOP
      (with a uniform scale of 0.015), and brought it into a Geo COMP. I planned
      to animate this geo later on. Then, I added a Camera COMP, Light COMP, and
      a Render TOP, where I set the resolution to 1080x1080, the pixel format to
      16-bit float (RGBA), and anti-aliasing to 16x—just enough for my laptops
      GPU. To clean up the look, I added an RGB Key to isolate the background
      and turn it fully black. A Luma Blur was used for subtle soft-focus
      effects, almost like tilt-shift photography. The magic started when I made
      two Ramp TOPs—one for red (vertical), and another for green (horizontal).
      I added Math TOPs to remap the values from -5 to 5, giving the particles
      more spatial spread. Then I used a Reorder TOP to merge channels and a
      Null to finalize the positioning data. This was plugged into the
      instancing parameters of the geo so that the red and green ramps
      controlled the X and Z translation. After adjusting the camera angle and
      light (switched to a Cone Light to hide grid edges), the grid began to
      look like it extended infinitely. For the color data, I brought in a
      Ramp-based image and used Math and Fit TOPs to scale and convert it to
      32-bit float. I assigned this to the instance color parameters (RGB +
      Alpha), giving each shape color variation. Finally, I added subtle
      rotation using an expression: me.time.seconds * 0.05 which added slow,
      hypnotic movement to the whole composition. While I kept the patch
      relatively minimal, I also experimented with reaction diffusion and emboss
      textures for future iterations. This version, though, was all about
      getting the basics right and letting each cube breathe with light and
      rhythm. The process was a combination of visual intuition, technical
      layering, and a fair bit of trial and error—but that is what I love most
      about TouchDesigner. It lets me sketch with code and improvise with light.
