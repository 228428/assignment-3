        Resolution Setup I started with a Constant CHOP to set my resolution to
        500. This defined how many instances I would generate. I connected it to
        a Null CHOP for stability.
      </p>
      <p>
        Render Network Foundation I created a Box SOP and left it as default.
        Then I added a Transform SOP, where I set the uniform scale to 0.015 to
        keep the boxes small. I brought this into a Geo COMP, which I planned to
        animate later.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lighting & Camera I added a Camera COMP, adjusting the position once I
        could see the full grid layout. I also added a Light COMP, which I later
        changed to a cone light to avoid seeing harsh black edges and create a
        sense of infinite depth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Render TOP Settings I added a Render TOP, setting the resolution to
        1080x1080, pixel format to 16 bit float (RGBA), and anti aliasing to 16x
        (high)—as much as my GPU could handle.
      </p>
      <p>
        Post-Processing I added a Luma Blur for subtle softness, then used an
        RGB Key to quickly remove the background and make it fully black. A
        final Null TOP outputted this render.
      </p>
      <p>
        Position Data from Ramps I created two Ramp TOPs, changed them to RGB:
        One vertical (Red channel) One horizontal (Green channel) I used Math
        TOPs to remap the values from 0 - 1 to -5 to 5. This gave me more
        spatial variation in the X and Z directions. I added a Reorder TOP to
        assign the red and green channels to translate X and translate Z.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instancing Setup I connected this reordered data to the Instancing OP on
        the Geo COMP. I set the translate X and Z to be driven by the R and G
        channels from the ramps.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fine-Tuning I played with the camera position until I got a nice view of
        the instanced boxes. I also tweaked the cone light to make the visual
        field more immersive.
